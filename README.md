# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

## Basic 3x3
A 3x3 tic-tac-toe game with a basic interface, including a button to switch between **dark mocde** and **light mode**

The **simplest method** to check for a win is to use a variable `winningPossibilities` in the `js` file to store all **winning positions** and sequentially check if there are three cells in a row (or column, or diagonal) with the same character

Since this is a 3x3 grid, the checking process doesnâ€™t take much time

## Grid 15x15 + Some Optimization
Increasing the game board size from 3x3 to 15x15 (or more if desired)

Using a function `addButtons()` to add 15x15 button elements to the `html` file instead of doing it manually like the 3x3 board

Since this is a 15x15 board, change the win condition from 3 consecutive characters in a row (or column, or diagonal) to 5 characters and **optimize** the win-checking method `checkWin()` by checking the row, column, and diagonal containing the newly added character each time a character is added. If 5 consecutive characters are found, **immediately** return a win result

Adding a `next round` button and `score board` to allow **playing multiple consecutive rounds**

**Known issue:** The interface may still be misaligned or not look good depending on the computer or phone screen

## Hexagonal Grids + Some Effects
Changing the shape of the cells from squares to **hexagons** to create a more visually appealing look

Adjusting the win-checking method `checkWin()` slightly to accommodate the new positions of the hexagonal cells

Adding **sound effects** for each cell click and an effect to **highlight** the hexagon cell when the mouse hovers over it

In the `css` file, change from `px` to `vw` to make the interface look better **regardless** of the screen size of the computer being used
